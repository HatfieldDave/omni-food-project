# IN Progress

## 1/14/22

Read the Content.md to get an idea of the project and what the client wants/needs for their website. I then took the information and built a rough outline for the site. that outlie is as follows...

- Navigation
- Hero
- Featured in
- How it works
- Meals (and list of diets)
- Testimonials + Gallery
- Pricing + features
- Call to action
- Footer

After this initial outline it would be a good idea to sketch out the website to get more of a visual idea of what the website could look like.

### First designs

Set up initial HTML and beginning css. Added a typography section to the top of the css file, the goal is for the sections inside to grow as I style so I can keep the sites design continuity.

Started on the Hero section of the site by adding a primary heading, a description, two btns (start eating well and learn more), and the hero imgs. began the initial styling of the hero using css grid.
